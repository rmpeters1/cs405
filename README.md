There are three game types for random moves, minimax, and montecarlo. \
Game is currently set up to use random AI moves with selfplay / autoplay turned on. \
Minimax is implemented and montecarlo is partially implemented. \
There is a pretty extensive game breaking bug that halts all three gametypes from running. \
Minimax and montecarlo will not finish but random moves for HW1 is able to run successfully.
